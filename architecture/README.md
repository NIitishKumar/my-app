# School Management System - Architecture

## 🏗️ Enterprise-Grade React + TypeScript Architecture

This is a **production-ready, scalable, feature-based architecture** designed for a large School Management System web application.

## 📁 Quick Navigation

- **[ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md](ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md)** - Architecture overview and principles
- **[COMPLETE_ARCHITECTURE_TREE.md](COMPLETE_ARCHITECTURE_TREE.md)** - Full folder tree (150+ files)

## 🎯 Key Features

### Architecture Patterns
- ✅ Feature-first organization
- ✅ Sub-features for complex modules
- ✅ Component-level colocation
- ✅ Custom hooks per feature and component
- ✅ No business logic in UI components
- ✅ API separation with React Query

### Implemented
- **Auth Feature** - Login, Register, Forgot Password
- **Admin Feature** - Dashboard, Classes, Teachers, Students
  - 8 API hooks
  - 7 large components with dedicated folders
  - Component-level hooks and types

### File Count
- **150+ files** across **60+ folders**
- **2 feature patterns** demonstrated
- **12 API hooks** implemented
- **7 large components** with co-located logic

## 🎓 How to Use This Architecture

### Adding a New Feature

1. **Copy the pattern** from `admin/` or `auth/`
2. **Create sub-features** if complex (multiple screens)
3. **Add API hooks** in `hooks/` folder
4. **Create components** - large ones get folders
5. **Export everything** via `index.ts`

### Example: Adding Teacher Feature

```bash
features/teacher/
├── dashboard/
│   ├── index.tsx
│   └── index.hook.ts
│
├── classes/
│   ├── index.tsx
│   └── components/
│       └── ClassList/
│           ├── ClassList.tsx
│           ├── ClassList.hook.ts
│           └── index.ts
│
├── hooks/
│   ├── useTeacherClasses.ts
│   └── useMarkAttendance.ts
│
└── index.ts
```

## ✅ Rules

1. Component folders ONLY for large components
2. Component hooks = UI logic only
3. API hooks in feature `hooks/` folder
4. No API calls in component folders
5. Every folder has `index.ts` for exports
6. No deep imports outside features

## 🔍 Key Files to Review

### Architecture Core
- `src/features/admin/` - Large feature pattern
- `src/features/auth/` - Medium feature pattern
- `src/components/common/` - Shared components
- `src/services/` - API infrastructure

### Examples
- `admin/classes/components/ClassTable/` - Large component
- `admin/hooks/useClassList.ts` - API hook
- `auth/login/index.hook.ts` - Page logic hook

## 📊 Statistics

| Metric | Count |
